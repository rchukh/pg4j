### Long term todos

- [hstore](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/hstore.html) support (may(or may not) be postponed until 9.4 version... see next section)

----------
### *As soon as those features will be ready and I will have time...* todos

- Consider using [pgjdbc-ng](https://github.com/impossibl/pgjdbc-ng) (mostly because of it's binary format).
- [Nested hstore with arrays support](http://www.pgcon.org/2013/schedule/events/518.en.html)
>   More details can be found [here](http://obartunov.livejournal.com/172503.html) and according to [this](http://obartunov.livejournal.com/174887.html) - there is already some progress in JSON support.
